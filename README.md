# KneighborsClassifier-With-Evaluation-Metrics

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch using `scikit-learn`, complete with evaluation metrics and result visualization. It was developed as part of a university machine learning lab assignment.

## Features

- Train a KNN model on a dataset
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Visualize results through:
- Line plots for the accuracies

## Libraries Used

- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
